__NOTE:__ this project is out of date and I haven't maintained it. My preferred means of building WPF apps now is using Caliburn.Micro or other alternatives to CompositeWPF. If you're interested in taking ownership or contributing, feel free to reach out or open a pull request.

## Introduction

StructureMap extension for CompositeWpf, primarily providing a StructureMapBootstrapper so that developers can use StructureMap as their IoC container of choice in CompositeWPF (i.e. Prism).
