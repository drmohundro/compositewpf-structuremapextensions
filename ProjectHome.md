NOTE: this project is out of date and I haven't maintained it. My preferred means of building WPF apps now is using Caliburn.Micro or other alternatives to CompositeWPF.

StructureMap extension for CompositeWpf, primarily providing a StructureMapBootstrapper so that developers can use StructureMap as their IoC container of choice in CompositeWPF (i.e. Prism).
